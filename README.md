This repository contains the final project report and Python simulation codes for the **CS166: Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems** course. 

The final project is an optimization problem requiring modeling and simulating a hypothetical waste removal company that has a truck (or a few trucks) that visits designated farms, collects waste from the farms, and drops the waste off at 1 or more waste sites. The road system is represented by a network that connects the farms, the waste removal company, and the waste drop-off sites. The ultimate goal is to determine a good collection schedule and route for the waste removal company given the uncertainty in the network (e.g., a farm might have no or very little waste). 

My model for this assignment is based on real-life data from the City Farm Movement in London. The report (PDF) that contains the data, assumptions, and analysis and the codes for the simulation are all uploaded in the repository.
